# Lab 7 - Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation

This lab demonstrates how to implement a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Simulation where a simulated robot in Webots is controlled by an external microcontroller (ESP32) programmed in MicroPython. The main goals are improving the line following bahaviour of the robot and implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to make the robot navigate the shortest paths between nodes.
